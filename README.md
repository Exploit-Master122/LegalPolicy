# LegalPolicy
- All of the stuff that you search never comes up on your search history.We do not save data on the website,because It is all saved through local servers on your device.
- If you get in trouble for using this,*THAT IS NOT MY OR ANYONE IN DARRKON NETWORK'S FAULT*,as *YOU* decided to use it.We provide a service.We did not create the demand.I regret that we live in a world where the demand is needed,when Trump blocked TikTok (for communication),or when schools blocked Quora (A research site). These unfair things are happening slowly. Take back your freedom, and Develop a better web!
- All of the iframed websites that I used are legal.It is legal to iframe third-party websites.
- Open source! Fork and do as you please. All I ask is that you give Darrkon Network credit,and try to join the Discord or the Github chat.
- Any disputes made with Darrkon Network,Google LLC,or Microsoft Corp,will be argued over with an article from the Safe Browsing agreement. If you think we are trying to st3@l data,then I reccomend that you stuff yourself (taxidermy) and try not to make a small group of teens bann3d from G1thub,and all of their hard work lost.
- Government laws will be changed.Today,Tommorrow,the Intended.Making the earth better. Bit,by bit. If you don't agree, then check out the [Article](https://exploitsdocessay.vercel.app/)
